# Dashboard
My attempt at a web based dashboard (See Dakboard).
Since I worked on and abandoned this back in 2017 I've used a couple different dashboards on my Raspberry Pi with a 7in Touchscreen. I'm currently using Balena Cloud and DAKboard on the device today and it works pretty well. 
Anyways, there is some decent code in here.
